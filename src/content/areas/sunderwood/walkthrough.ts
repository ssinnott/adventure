// Sunderwood's walkthrough. Its chapter, The Wall, is #204's, which plays it here; until then, the
// Eaves' way in (I2, #195) walked: the east road out of Thornmark over the Hoarhills, the secret
// under the milestone found from its hints, the box's groups won at its floor, and the crest along
// its south shut against the Deepthorn, so the road is the only way between the two areas. Then the
// Eaves (J2, #196): the road on through the pines, the rim of the Sunder seen, the secret in the
// bear's cave found from the dog and the cutter's word, and the box's groups won at its floor. Then
// Sunderfall (K2, #197): the rope bridge crossed, the ledge behind the quiet fall found from its
// rocks, and the box's groups won at its floor. Then Lanternwood (L2, #200): the road on through the
// wood to the tower's gate, shut until #201, the pit under the signal fire's ash found from the ash
// and the young sister's word, and the box's groups won at its floor. Then the Sunder's mouth (K3,
// #198): the ledges walked down past the gleaners to the door and the camp below it, the river's old
// bed found from its stones and the stack across it, the box's bears won at its floor, and its Rift
// walked into and won, its groups still coming back. Then the Sunder (#199): in at the door on the
// first landing, down the ledges and over the thread, the gleaners' cache, down to the floor, its
// groups and the Warden won, the wall found and the seam behind the chalk's last mark; the Warden
// stays dead and the rest come back.
