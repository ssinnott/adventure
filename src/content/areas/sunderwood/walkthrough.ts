// Sunderwood's walkthrough. Its chapter, The Wall, is #204's, which plays it here; until then, the
// Eaves' way in (I2, #195) walked: the east road out of Thornmark over the Hoarhills, the secret
// under the milestone found from its hints, the box's groups won at its floor, and the crest along
// its south shut against the Deepthorn, so the road is the only way between the two areas. Then the
// Eaves (J2, #196): the road on through the pines, the rim of the Sunder seen, the secret in the
// bear's cave found from the dog and the cutter's word, and the box's groups won at its floor. Then
// Sunderfall (K2, #197): the rope bridge crossed, the ledge behind the quiet fall found from its
// rocks, and the box's groups won at its floor.
